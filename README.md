Hi, I'm Michael Skowronek.

I'm currently doing my Master in Computer Science at University of Paderborn, Germany.

My focus is on Machine Learning.

I also have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering (and separately Computer Science, to avoid confusion).

Fitting this perfectly, I have a job on a project which does research on combining Machine Learning and Control Theory.

You can reach me at michael.skowronek.91@gmail.com.
