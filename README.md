Hi, I'm Michael Skowronek.

I'm currently doing my master's in Computer Science at University of Paderborn, Germany.

My focus is on Machine Learning. I'm familiar with Bayesian Methods including GPs, EM, Variational Methods, EP, MCMC. Also some Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing.

I also have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering (In addition to my CS-Bachelor).

I'm involved in some project which researches on combining Machine Learning and Control Engineering.
I'm also involved in another project with tries to improve on state-of-the-art Question Answering.
