Hi, I'm Michael Skowronek.

I'm currently doing my master's in Computer Science at University of Paderborn, Germany.

I also have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering (In addition to my CS-Bachelor).

My focus is on Machine Learning. I'm familiar with Bayesian Methods including GPs, EM, Variational Inference, EP, MCMC. Also some Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing.

I'm involved in some project which researches on combining Machine Learning and Control Engineering.
I'm also involved in another project which tries to improve Question Answering.
