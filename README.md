Hi, I'm Michael Skowronek.

I'm currently doing my master's in Computer Science at University of Paderborn, Germany.

I also have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering (In addition to my CS-Bachelor).

My focus is on Machine Learning. I'm familiar with Bayesian Methods including GPs, EM, Variational Inference, EP, MCMC. Also some Reinforcement Learning and a lot of Natural Language Processing.

I'm involved in a project which researches on applying Machine Learning to Control Engineering.
In another project we try to improve the state of Question Answering.
